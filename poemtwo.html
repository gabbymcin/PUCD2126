			<h1>GOOD LIFE II</h1>
			<h2>ZHU</h2>

<p class="one">
Life is all about you and not at all about you
Now, that's two opposing thoughts and yet both of them are true
How can you experience everything you choose to do
While observing the experience you're having from a higher view
See, it's the question, not the answer, that's the higher view
Otherwise, you couldn't differentiate between the two
</p>


  <p> Gratitude is my destination
	My destiny is perfectly aligned with this location
	I am the map, so I travel back in time
	I have everything I want cause my imagination is mine
	But mind is not enough for me cause I am not my mind
	I could see it all, but never get to see I'm truly blind
	I could be it all, but all identities intertwine
	The moon is only bright cause it reflects the sun's shine</p> 

  <p> I could be it all, Ill make a good life
	Let me lose my mind its the only way to love
	Only way to only way to love </p> 
 

  <p> It's not the human race, it's just the human race
	There's nothing left to chase, we do not run this place
	But both medicine and poison's an acquired taste
	So I started taking selfies of somebody else's face </p>

	<p> Tell me something
	What is more genius than a child's laughter
	Are we not simply the children of this world?</p>
