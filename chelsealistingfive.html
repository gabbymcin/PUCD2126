    While looking for an apartment, like may others, I had to deal with many real estate agents. Let's face it, now is not a renters market and many agents use it very literally -  treating customers very unprofessionally at best and like dirt at worst. This is not the case with TB Shaw. I was pleased with Robert who treated me with respect and wasn't annoying trying to push on me. When an apartment would come up that was close to my requirements he would call and offer to come look at it. No pressure, no gimmicks. Even though I didn't find apartment that I wanted with TB I still recommend them. Hope you have a similar experience

    My boyfriend and I were moving from Kentucky to Brooklyn, but didn't have time to visit first to find an apartment. I contacted Amy Martinez-Miller to help us find a place, even though we couldn't be there to actually see anything. So basically she was our eyes and ears, and we had to trust her to find the perfect place within a couple of months. Amy was amazing, very quick to respond and helpful with all of our questions. Took us on FaceTime tours of each place and gave us her true opinion after leaving. She wasn't quick to recommend a place just to get a sale, she told us what she really thought and genuinely wanted us to find a great place. She ended up helping us find an awesome apartment in Windsor Terrace, close to work, great street, and dog friendly (which was a must, but hard to come by with our budget).

    Mary at TB Shaw deserves 10 stars, but 5 will have to do: She is decent, honest, and an all around nice person. She listens and does not show you apartments you can't afford, or are not what you are looking for. She found me an apartment I loved 6 years ago, and just helped me again (I ultimately found a place through family) before I found my next home. She is really easy to work with and everyone seems to love her. She is cooperative with other brokers and hard working. If you're looking for a place in Park Slope, she's a neighborhood fixture and a great resource.
